        <h3>Pre-primary - Middle School</h3>
        <p>Mongar Middle Secondary School | 2010 - 2020</p>
        <p>
          Unlike the young children now a days, I did not  start my education from Early Childhood Center(ECCD). Rather, I directly got enrolled in class PP in the year 2010 in Mongar Lower 
         Secondary School when I was 4 and half years old. Starting from that year, I continued my schoolings in that same school, which was then upgraded to middle school. I had completed 
         my education for past 10 years in that same school. Thus, this school holds a special place in my heart. All my childhood memories were created in this school.

        <h4>High School</h4>
        <p>Mongar Higher Secondary School | 2021 - 2022</p>
        <p>
          To continue my high school, I got enrolled in Mongar Higher Secondary School in the year 2021. It is located just above my middle school. 
        In grade 11, I took Arts as my stream as I was interested in subjects like English, Geography, Economics, etc...  During my high school days,
        I was able to explore a bit more and interact with lots of new friends as all the students from different places gathered together in one school. 
        Reminiscing about the memories that I had created in grade 12 was an exciting and an interesting part of my high school days. Being the senior most
        student in the school, we could enjoy the freedom, and the opportunities that we get to control over our younger juniors.
        I feel forever grateful to all my teachers for their guidance, supports, and punishments. With their guidance, I was able to perform well in
        my BHSEC examinations. Remembering about high school days makes me want to go back.

        <p>Samtse College of Education | 2023 - Present</p>
        <p>
          I am  currently in my 3rd year at Samtse College of Education, pursuing a degree in Information Technology, and every day here brings new opportunities
       to learn and grow. Beyond exploring the world of ICT, I am preparing for my ultimate goal, becoming a passionate and inspiring teacher. The college
       has given me hands-on experiences through projects, lesson planning, and micro-teaching sessions, helping me build both my technical skills and teaching
       confidence. I am  excited to combine my love for technology and education to make a meaningful impact in the classroom and guide the next generation of learners.

    <div class="Skills">
      <h3>Technical Skill – Web Development</h3>
      <img src="images/technical.jpg" alt="Technical Skill">
      <p>
        I am actively learning and exploring web development, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I participated in a group project to design an Online
      Hostel Management System website using Figma, where I tried creating layouts, experimenting with colors and fonts, and arranging interactive elements. While I am 
      still improving my coding skills, I enjoy practicing responsive designs to ensure websites work well on different devices. I am also getting familiar with tools like VS
      Code and GitHub to manage and track my work efficiently. Each project helps me understand real-world applications, experiment with new features, and gradually gain confidence 
      in building websites. I look forward to learning more advanced web development techniques and improving my problem-solving skills through hands-on practice.
      </p>

      <h4>Soft Skill – Communication</h4>
      <img src="images/6softskill.webp" alt="Communication Skill">
      <p>
        I am continuously developing my communication skills, both in speaking and writing. While I may not be an expert yet, I make an effort to express my ideas clearly
      during group discussions, class activities, and collaborative projects. For instance, in team projects, I explain my thoughts on layouts or project tasks to teammates 
      and also listen carefully to their suggestions. I also practice writing simple summaries or instructions to help others understand our work better. Even when presenting in
      front of a class, I try to stay calm, explain step by step, and answer questions, learning more each time. I see communication as a skill that grows with experience, and I am
      motivated to improve it through continuous practice and active participation.

      <h5>Working Experience</h5>
      <img src="images/shop.jpg" alt="Working Experience">
      <p>
        After I completed my BHSEC examinations, I went to Gedu at my grandparent's place to help my aunt, who is currently running a business.
      During my five months in Gedu helping my aunt with her business, I developed valuable skills in customer service, communication, and business management. 
      I learned how to interact with different types of customers, organize and manage shop operations, and take responsibility for daily tasks such as arranging goods, 
      unloading supplies, and handling busy sales periods.Living away from my parents for the first time also taught me independence, adaptability, and time management, 
      while working alongside my aunt strengthened my sense of teamwork and responsibility. This experience not only gave me exposure to real-world challenges but also 
      motivated me to pursue higher education and personal growth.

      <h6>Cooking & Foodie Passion</h6>
      <img src="images/cooking.jpg" alt="Cooking">
      <p>
        Cooking is one of my favorite hobby and also a reflection of my foodie side. I love exploring different cuisines, experimenting with flavors, and trying out
      new recipes whenever I get the chance. Being a foodie makes me more curious and adventurous in the kitchen, and I enjoy turning simple ingredients into something 
      delicious and presentable. Through cooking, I have developed patience, creativity, and time management, as it often requires multitasking and precision. Most importantly,
      cooking gives me joy not only in preparing meals for myself but also in sharing them with family and friends, creating moments of happiness around food.</p>

        <p>
          In this project, we developed a smart flower pot that could detect soil moisture and water plants automatically. While the water pump functioned successfully, 
        the soil moisture detection feature faced programming issues. This project taught me the importance of problem-solving, troubleshooting code, and iterative development. 
        It was an enriching experience that highlighted the challenges of real-world IoT projects. This project was completed in the recent semester.

          A database-driven system to manage orders, menu, and transactions for a college canteen.In this project, I focused on designing a system to manage canteen 
        operations efficiently. My work included creating objectives, data collection methods, ER models, relational schema, and class diagrams. The project helped me understand 
        system design principles, database modeling, and business rules, and improved my ability to organize and structure an IT project from start to finish. This project was
        completed in the Spring Semester.

        <p>
          For this semesters module, my group designed a website for online hostel management using Figma. The project involved creating wireframes, designing the user interface,
        and ensuring a smooth user experience for managing hostel bookings and facilities online. Through this project, I improved my UI/UX design skills, teamwork, and planning abilities,
        and gained practical experience in translating ideas into interactive prototypes.
